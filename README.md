# Lunch websites

During my time at the school, I hosted the very popular https://20alse.ssis.nu/lunch website where you could browse and find the current school menu.
I also created a "legacy" version of this website that runs on really old computers and uses PHP instead of JavaScript for retrieving data.
Both of these websites are available in this repo and they both use my [EateryCacher API](https://github.com/sotpotatis/EateryCacher).
